It is also known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) or Zulu Time (Z). UTC is a time zone that is not affected by daylight saving time or other local time adjustments, and it is used as a reference time for many different applications, including computer systems, aviation, and international communications.

The POSIX locale is a standard locale that defines the behavior of C programs running on POSIX-compliant systems, and it is used as a basis for many other locales. The en_US_POSIX locale is often used in software development to ensure consistent behavior across different platforms and to avoid issues with localization and internationalization.

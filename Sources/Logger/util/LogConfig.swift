    * - Note: The UTC in the selected code refers to Coordinated Universal Time, which is a time standard that is used as a basis for timekeeping around the world. It is also known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) or Zulu Time (Z). UTC is a time zone that is not affected by daylight saving time or other local time adjustments, and it is used as a reference time for many different applications, including computer systems, aviation, and international communications. 
    * - Note: In the context of the LogConfig struct, the UTC time zone is used to ensure that the log messages are timestamped consistently regardless of the local time zone of the user or the system running the logger.
    * - Note: The selected code en_US_POSIX is a locale identifier that specifies the POSIX locale with US English language settings. The POSIX locale is a standard locale that defines the behavior of C programs running on POSIX-compliant systems, and it is used as a basis for many other locales. The en_US_POSIX locale is often used in software development to ensure consistent behavior across different platforms and to avoid issues with localization and internationalization.
    * - Note: In the context of the LogConfig struct, the en_US_POSIX locale is used to ensure that the date and time formatting is consistent regardless of the user's locale settings

/**
 * This file contains the LogTag enum which is used to categorize logs.
 * Each case in the enum represents a different category of logs.
 * The raw value of each case is an emoji that visually represents the category.
 *
 * Remark: It's nice to turn off network logs sometimes etc, as they can be annoying and verbose.
 *
 * - Fixme: ⚠️️ We can make emojis customizable, see note in LogLevel
 * - Fixme: ⚠️️ Consider adding an appstore log category, or is payment good enough?
